          <strong>hey guys!Welcome to my blog</strong>

          <br />
          This is where i share my personal feelings,experiences,hopes and dreams with the world(<em>whomsoever reads it at least</em>).<br />
          Currently i have hit rock bottom and from the looks of it i am going to be here for a while.
          Nothing is going my way and i have begun to slowly realise that this might just end up being my fate.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Read on further to climb into my world of sorrow and despair!</strong>
